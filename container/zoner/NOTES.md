## zavd - Zoner AntiVirus daemon

### SYNOPSIS

`zavd ACTION [OPTIONS]`

### DESCRIPTION

Zavd is the Zoner AntiVirus daemon. It runs in the background, starts its modules and waits for scan requests from clients (or specific modules, like on-acces, mail or web scanner).

### ACTIONS

-s, --start
start ZAVd and all its modules
-x, --stop
stop ZAVd and all its modules
-r, --restart
stop and then start ZAVd
-v, --version
retrieve ZAVd and scanner versions
-u, --update
update scanner from ZAV servers
-t, --status
test if ZAVd is running and print statistics
-p, --ping
only test if ZAVd is running
-o, --short
print short-term statistics
-e, --reset
print and reset short-term statistics

### OPTIONS

-n, --no-daemon
do not daemonize (for debugging)
-c, --config-dir=DIR
path to ZAVd configuration files

### RETURN CODES

```
0 - success
1 - error
2 - ZAVd is already running (only for -s)
3 - ZAVd is not running (for -t, -o and -p)
4 - ZAVd is not running and has been badly terminated
5 - ZAVd is running, but shared memory is corrupted
```

## zavcli - Zoner AntiVirus command-line interface

### DESCRIPTION

Zavcli is a command-line client for Zoner AntiVirus daemon (ZAVd). All PATHs are scanned for viruses and results are printed to standard output.

### BASIC OPTIONS

-v, --version
display zavcli version information and exit
-V, --version-zavd
display ZAVd version information and exit
-h, --help
display this help and exit
-n, --no-recurse
do not traverse directories

### SCAN OPTIONS

These options override default values set for ZAVd in its configuration file:
--(no-)scan-full
continue to scan current file after an infection found
--(no-)scan-heuristics
perform heuristic analysis (can detect a previously unknown virus)
--(no-)scan-emulation
run PE emulator to check binaries
--(no-)scan-archives
decompress archives and check their content
--(no-)scan-packers
decompress files compressed by runtime-packers (e.g. UPX)
--(no-)scan-gdl
use Generic Detection Language to check files
--(no-)scan-phishing
enable heuristic phishing detection
--(no-)scan-deep
scan the whole file (not only the first few MB)
--scan-maxsize=SIZE
unpack only SIZE bytes from an archive
--scan-maxfiles=NUM
unpack up to NUM files from an archive
--scan-recursion=NUM
stop after reaching NUM level of nested archives (i.e. archive in archive in ...)
--scan-timeout=TIME
stop scanning afer TIME seconds and return partial results (will be limited by global ZAVd configuration)
--scan-level=LEVEL
how thorough the scanner should be: fastest, normal, advanced or brute
--scan-dev
do not omit /dev directory (not recommended)
--scan-proc
do not omit /proc directory (not recommended)
--scan-sys
do not omit /sys directory (not recommended)

### PERFORMANCE OPTIONS

-t, --threads=NUM
run zavcli in NUM threads (faster, if ZAVd runs more scanner instances)
-w, --timeout=TIME
disconnect from ZAVd after TIME seconds (default: 300)

### OUTPUT OPTIONS

-q, --quiet
be quiet (only error messages are printed)
-s, --stats
print overall statistics after scanning is done (number of clean files, infected files, errors, etc.)
-i, --scan-info
print scan time and filesize for every scanned file (e.g. " 0.000.123 12345 /tmp/file")
--tree
instead of only printing found virus names, print also infected sub-files (useful for archives)
--color
use colorized terminal output
--show=RESTYPES
show only RESTYPES scan results, hide the rest
--no-show=RESTYPES
suppress RESTYPES scan results, show the rest
Possible RESTYPES:
clean - files without any infection
infected - malware pattern found
probinfected - probably infected files (a known but uncertain pattern detected)
suspicious - suspicious files (mostly executables and phishing files)
nonstandard - files that are not really suspicious, but somehow different from normal files
unknown - files with an unknown type of infection, caused by old ZAVd/ZAVCli with newer ZAVCore
scanerror - files causing an error during scanning
timeout - files where a user-defined timeout has been reached during scanning
all - all of the above
FILTERING OPTIONS
--no-symlinks
do not follow symbolic links
--no-mounts
do not follow mountpoints (do not change the device, specified by the PATH argument)
--maxsize=SIZE
do not scan files larger than SIZE (default: unlimited), you can append units: 'B', 'k', 'M' or 'G'
--minsize=SIZE
do not scan files smaller than SIZE (default: 0), you can append units: 'B', 'k', 'M' or 'G'

### ADVANCED OPTIONS

-c, --config-dir=DIR
path to ZAVd configuration files, used to adjust maximum number of threads and to find ZAVd socket, by default zavcli tries '/etc/zav' and '~/.zav'
-z, --zavd-socket=FILE
path to ZAVd socket, which is needed to scan files; use this option instead of -c when calling zavcli externally, this way no configuration file is parsed (faster)
--conn-retries=N
when ZAVd cannot be reached, retry N times (default: 1)
--conn-interval=TIME
when ZAVd cannot be reached, try again after TIME seconds (default: 1)
--remove=RESTYPES
remove files having RESTYPES results after scanning (use with caution)
--copy=OPTS
copy files after scanning, OPTS are of the form RESTYPE=DIR

### RETURN CODES

These return codes apply either to a single file (if only one file specified) or represent the most important result from all files that have been scanned during execution (if more files/directories specified).

```
0: - clean - all files clean, no errors
1: - error - zavcli encountered an error (glibc call or syscall)
2: - scanerror - ZAVd returned an error
11: - infected - file has been infected by a known virus
12: - probably infected - file has been infected by a virus, but the detection is not doubtless
13: - suspicious - file looks supicious (virus-like behaviour of a binary, phishing attempts, possible exploits)
14: - nonstandard - file has some non-standard attributes, but is not really suspicious (only few symptoms)
15: - unknown - file has been infected by an unknown type of infection (caused by obsolete ZAVd version)
16: - timeout - the scanning has timed out
```
